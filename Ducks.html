    <p>
      <b>hyletDuck</b>is the common <button>name</button> for numerous species
      of waterfowl in the family Anatidae. Ducks are generally smaller and
      shorter-necked than swans and geese, which are also members of the same
      family. Divided among several subfamilies, they are a form taxon; they do
      not represent a monopic group (the group of all descendants of a single
      common ancestral species), since swans and geese are not considered ducks.
      Ducks are mostly aquatic birds, mostly smaller than the swans and geese,
      and may be found in both fresh water and sea water.
